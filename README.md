## Running the application
The best way to run the web application is using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). If you do not have docker installed or dont know what it is, see below for instructions.

Once you have your [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) environment up and running, navigate to your local folder containing this repository

From there you need to do the following three step:
- Run the '''./1-build.sh''' command
- - This will build the container as specified in the Docker file
